SPA -> Single Page Application

React react.js -> frontend /UI Javascript library

Angular -> Javascript framework

React ->
UI Javascript library
SPA
JSX (javascript XML)-> it allows us to write HTML in React.

Rule -
1. we can render only one block from a component
2. Component can be function or class
	function Fun(){}
	class Fun(){}
3. component name should start with capital letter
4. Compoent should be exportable so that in other component we can import and use it.
5. Component extension .js or .jsx 
	App.js or App.jsx
6. {}

==================================
Component - > components are like functions that returns HTML element.
Compoents are basic buliding block to perfrom a specific task.
independent and reusable

Two Types- 
1. functional 
2. Class -> 
		class 
		pure
		memo
		higer order etc.
When we create class component -> React has a Component class so each class component has to inherit that React.Component class.
		

Snippets ->
rfc or rfce-> functional component snippet
rcc  -> class component snippet
rconst -> for constructor
======================================================================
From Parent send data to child component and data is read only means the child component can not make any changes in the data.

props -> 
<DisplayEmployee id="101" name="smith" salary="400000"></DisplayEmployee>

props are ready only.

In functional component if we want to use props and make some changes in the data we have to use React Hooks concept.

In class Component if we want to use props and make some changes -> use state
class -> statefull component

state ->
