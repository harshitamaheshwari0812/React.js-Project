When we uses state -> 
1. state change -> render() will get called
2. if we are increasing the value of textbox by button and if we ahve not specify the onChange event on textebox then my textbox is readonly


Create ref to avoid above problems -
1. create reference in constructor of the class
2. bind your textbox with ref variable
3. increase ref value on button click so use function increaseQty and increase the ref value.
	To access the ref value we have to use current property of ref


Autofocus to textbox

Note -> ref can not be attach to a function component.

To use ref in functional component, we have to use forwardRef()
Hooks -> useRef
